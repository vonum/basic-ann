# Basic Artificial Neural Network
Minimal neural network with one hidden layer.

### Example with mnist data set
Trained with 60000 examples of human written digits and tested on 10000 examples.
Network was set to have 200 hidden layer nodes and a learning rate of 0.1.
Network was trained in 3 epochs and got an accuracy of 0.9709.

The full [mnist data set](http://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/) in CSV format.

Check out the [notebook](mnist_example.ipynb).
